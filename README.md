# natural-language-tests #

Some experiments in using the Natural Language Toolkit for Python.

This is nothing profesional, just a collection of scripts I've been writing to test out the capabilities of Python's NLTK package for Natural Language Processing.

If you're interested in running any of the scripts to test things out for yourself, HOWTO.md contains a short how-to guide for running them.
